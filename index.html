                        <p> This program is about the youth encouragement to be socially involved. The program, "Bata Bata Magensayo Ka" was inpired by the precious incident in the school barangay where three of their students was teased and bullied. They were threatend to give money, thus the barangay officials and concern citizens in the barangay proposed a program to encourage "out of school youth" to participate in a Basketball: Liga. Through the said program, a lot of youth turned their habits and vices to playing basketball. The barangay is proud to say, "Incident's like before is now minimal". </p>
                        <p>
                        The coach of the basketball must be very strict to them, for the youth to be discipline and they should know how to manage their time. It also help them to be matured enough for them to be motivated and for them to be challenge.
